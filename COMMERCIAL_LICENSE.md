## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I start with the open source license and upgrade later?
**A:** Yes. Many customers start with the Sovereignty License to evaluate, then upgrade to Commercial when ready for production deployment.

### Q: What happens if I stop paying?
**A:** You retain rights to versions released during your subscription period. You lose access to updates, support, and new features.

### Q: Do I need a commercial license for internal use?
**A:** No. The Sovereignty License allows unlimited internal use. Commercial licenses are only required if you distribute proprietary products or need professional support.

### Q: Can I get a trial?
**A:** Yes. We offer 30-day commercial license trials for qualified organizations.

### Q: Is there a startup discount?
**A:** Yes. Pre-revenue startups qualify for the $10K Startup tier (normally $50K).

### Q: How does this compare to other security licenses?
**A:** Unlike MongoDB's SSPL or Elastic's proprietary license, we maintain true open source core with transparent commercial terms. No bait-and-switch.
